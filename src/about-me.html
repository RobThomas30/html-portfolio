            Hi I'm Rob Thomas, a junior developer.
          </p>
          <p> 
            Before becoming a programmer I worked as a mechanic and vehicle manufacturer. Mechanics taught me to think mechanically, methodically and identify problems. While manufacturing taught me processes and how to plan and follow steps.
            I believe these skills can be used practically for my new programming career.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy a challenge and being creative which shows in my interests. Gaming can be challenging and brings out my competitive nature,
            but I also like to get creative and draw or put together aquariums and terrariums.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning to program has been a great experience and is quickly becoming not only a means of living but a new hobby.

              <p>Git is great, it not only prevents you from losing your progress but lets you take some risks if it ruins your code, you can just revert back and try something else. I use it on all my projects and I'm improving every day.</p>

            <p>CSS can be frustrating when you can't quite find where your page has gone wrong, but it gives a great sense of satisfaction to finally nail it and see your page fall into order.</p>
