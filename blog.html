            <h2>The First Spacewalk - 1965</h2>

          <p>
            On March 18, 1965 Alexey Leonov performed the first spacewalk when, while in orbit around the Earth, he left the Voskhod 2 capsule for extravehicular activity. For 12 minutes he was in frigid outer space with only his space suit on. While outside, the suit ballooned and Leonov hardly managed to get back into his spaceship. The mission experienced further complications during its return to Earth: The Voskhod 2 missed the landing zone by a few hundred kilometers. Leonov and his fellow cosmonaut had to spent two nights in the woods before returning to their Baikonur mission base. Yet overall the mission was a success. The Soviets were still ahead in the space race.

            Most people of a certain age can remember exactly where they were on July 20, 1969. People around the world were glued to their TVs when the lunar module of Apollo 11 touched down at the Sea of Tranquility and Neil Armstrong uttered the famous words: “that's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind”. Armstrong and his fellow Buzz Aldrin spent almost a full day on the moon's surface. After eight days the Apollo 11 mission was safely back on Earth.

            The Soviets had initially been ahead in the space race, but the moon landing had secured US victory. Until 1972 there were a total of six moon landings by NASA. Twelve men have walked on the surface of the moon. Almost 50 years on, no other nation or organization has attempted a manned moon landing.

            Viking 1 touched down on the red planet's surface on July 20, 1976 after a ten month journey. It was the first spacecraft to land on another planet successfully and perform its mission. Previous attempts (by the Soviets) to land on Venus and Mars either crash-landed or stopped transmitting shortly after landing. Viking 1 began sending the first pictures of Martian rocks minutes after landing and continued to do so for 2,307 days (or 2,245 sols, i.e. Martian days).

          <p>
            Following the success of the Viking mission NASA sent a serious of rovers to Mars (Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity). Unlike stationary landers like Viking, rovers allow the exploration of a much wider area and the focus on particular points of interest. As of December 2016 Opportunity and Curiosity are still operational with the former having run a distance of over 40 km (25 mi) on the Martian surface. All Martian landers and rovers are equipped with biological sensors, yet none has detected clear signs of past life.

            The Voyager program consisted to two robotic probes launched in 1977 to study the outer solar system. Although the primary focus of the mission was to study the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn with their respective moons, Voyager 2 continued well to the outer planets Uranus and Neptune. Neither of these two ice giants has been visited by any other probe. Voyager 1 on the other hand continued to travel outbound at a speed of 17 km/s (11 mi/s), entering interstellar space in 2012 as the first man-made object ever. Both spacecraft are expected to remain operational until about 2025.

            The International Space Station is a habitable artificial satellite in low Earth orbit. Not the first, but largest and most lasting of its kind, the ISS has continuously been inhabited since the arrival of the first residential crew in November 2000. The ISS circles at a height of 330-435 km (205-270 mi) and orbits the Earth about 15 times a day, serving as research laboratory for a wide range of science fields: biology, space medicine, astronomy, physics, astrobiology, meteorology etc. One of the station's main purposes is to find out whether lengthy human space flight and space colonization are feasible. This in preparation of a human Mars mission.
          </p>
          <p>
          The ISS is a truly international project: Russian rockets and the American space shuttles have been used for its construction. Furthermore, the European Space Agency (ESA), Japan and Canada participate in this project. As of 2016, the station has received residents or visitors from 17 different nations.

            Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster is an electric sports car that served as the dummy payload for the February 2018 Falcon Heavy test flight and became an artificial satellite of the Sun. "Starman", a mannequin dressed in a spacesuit, occupies the driver's seat. The car and rocket are products of Tesla and SpaceX, respectively, both companies founded by Elon Musk. The 2008-model Roadster was previously used by Musk for commuting to work and is the only production car in space. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The car, mounted on the rocket's second stage, acquired enough velocity to escape Earth's gravity and enter an elliptical heliocentric orbit crossing the orbit of Mars.[5] The orbit reaches a maximum distance from the Sun at aphelion of 1.66 astronomical units (au).[3] During the early portion of the voyage outside the Earth's atmosphere, live video was transmitted back to the mission control center and live-streamed for slightly over four hours
