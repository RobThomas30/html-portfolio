          <p>
            Hi I'm Rob Thomas, a junior developer! I use to be a mechanic which I believe gives me a step up on the competition it taught me to think mechanically, methodically and identify problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy a challenge and being creative which shows in my interests Gaming can be challenging and brings out my competitive nature,
            but I also like to get creative and draw or put together aquariums and terrariums.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning to program has been a great experience and is quickly becoming not only a means of living but a new hobby.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks for dropping by!

              <p>Git is great, it not only prevents you from losing your progress but lets you take some risks if it ruins your code, you can just revert back and try something else. I use it on all my projects and I'm improving every day.</p>

            <p>CSS can be frustrating when you can't quite find where your page has gone wrong, but it gives a great sense of satisfaction to finally nail it and see your page fall into order.</p>
